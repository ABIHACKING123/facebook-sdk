class facebook.GraphAPI
========
A client for the Facebook Graph API. The Graph API is made up of the objects or
nodes in Facebook (e.g., people, pages, events, photos) and the connections or
edges between them (e.g., friends, photo tags, and event RSVPs). This client
provides access to those primitive types in a generic way.
